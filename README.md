# Akky

The gateway to the world of Decentralized file storage, sharing and discovery

## Project Description

Akky is a decentralized storage system developed using Akave. It supports all file types, from pdfs to videos, images to audio clips. 

## The need

Right now the first and foremost problem with data storage and sharing is the the high possibility of a security breach. Data breaches can lead to the exposing of sensitive data. 

More over, due to centralization, privacy concerns and the consequences of having to trust a third party with your private information is also ery prevalent.

Moreover, concentration of power in the hands of few large corporations leads to monopolisation of the industry, giving them freedom to charge premium fees, and implement strategies such as ecosystem trapping.

Other factors include scalability limitations and being vulnerable to natural disasters(due to concentration of hardware in certain regions).

## How we solve the problem

Enter Akky, a Decentralized file storage system built on Akave, leveraging the low cost and scalable (provided data storage is done keeping prevention of data redundancy in mind). 

On Akky, any user can access/upload data on chain using their wallet address as the key to their account. It allows for very easy and seamless data storage, and works great for even audio clips.
Initially we planned on using Akky with the vision of developing a decentralized Spotify, but later relaized that it was capable of storing all types of data efficiently. Here, we run our own local node for implementation.

## Features
- MetaMask wallet integration : For authentication of users

- Data uploading / storage on Akave Chain.

- Support for images(jpeg, png), audio files, pdfs, etc

## Challenges we ran into
- Akave API: There was an issue in the uploading file api of the node, due to which files were not being uploaded easily.

## Future scope
- **Data encryption:** Right now data is stored as is on the chain, making it publicly available. Due to time limitations, we were not able to encrypt the data before uploading on chain

- **Easy data sharing:** We plan on implementing data sharing among users

- **Data indexing:** Implementing our own subgraph for this protocol will enable easier access and querying. 

## Tech Stack:
- NodeJS, Metamask, Akave
